# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
# 
# before running xfinity monitor, delete previous geckodriver log (not possible to suppress)
45 1-23/2 * * * rm /home/pi/Public/xfinity-usage-monitor/data/geckodriver.log
# run xfinity monitor at 10 minutes before every even hour, so you get close to end of day
50 1-23/2 * * * export DISPLAY=:0; bash /home/pi/Public/xfinity-usage-monitor/run_xfinity_monitor.sh
# at the top of each even hour, copy the plot to web server page
00 */2 * * * /bin/cp -u /home/pi/Public/xfinity-usage-monitor/data/* /var/www/html/data
# at the start of each month, save off the plot of xfinity usage from prior month
00 1 1 * * bash /home/pi/Public/xfinity-usage-monitor/run_xfinity_plot.sh
